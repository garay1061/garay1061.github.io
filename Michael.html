<h1>Michael Garay</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Michael Garay I am 15 years old i was born on october 17 2002, and I like to play soccer, hang out with my friends, and play video games. I started playing soccer when i was 5, and in second grade I started playing on a travel team the
    club was hoffman united and my team name was red devils. In fifth grade I got my first game console which was the xbox 360 and it was my favorite console that's why I now have an xbox one which I got in seventh grade and it keeps me in touch with my
    friends because since high school we don't really get to see each other that often. my favorite colors are red and white thats why I am using a red adn white text color. soccer has been in my life forever i love it so much i go on weekends with my friends to play and
    i used to play with my dad in an indoor friendly with a bunch of older people. </p>
