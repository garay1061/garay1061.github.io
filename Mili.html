<h1>Mili</h1>

<p>My dog mili is a chocolate lab mix she is 10 years old and loves to play outside in the yard. when we first got Mili i was in kindergarten adn my sister was in second grade and my mom told me that we were<br>
    going to get something when we picked up my sister and i thought we were going to get toys but then we went to the shelter and got Mili. she was so tiny and shy she wouldn't want to leave from under a chair<br>
    that was in the room and she was so cute now she roams the backyard by herself and goes by my grandparents house when were at school.
