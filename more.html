<p>I am the youngest in my family i have a older sister she is 17 and goes to HEHS she was born on february 27 2001, and her favorite color is blue and she plays soccer like me. she enjoys hanging out with her boyfriend and his family also she
    sometimes forgets about me when she with him so i get ignored when i need something or need to go somewhere. this last summer we went to california and she really wants to go to hawaii but i don't want to
    go there. another thing about my sister is she did dance when she was little and gymnastics but she didn't do it for long also she is allergic to peanuts and has asthma so she has been to the ER numerous
    amounts of times because she couldn't breath.
