My sister is obsessed with the show friends so in California we went on a warner bros studio tour and got to see the Friends set also if you could'nt tell i don't like smiling in pictures.
<br><br><br>
<p> now to start talking about my family. My dad is 51 years old he plays soccer in a co-ed league on sundays every week
    and he works as an accountant so he does paperwork for a restaurant he used to own. When he was 18 he moved here from mexico and went to college when he was 40 because he couldn't afford to go so he went after me and my sister were born. after he went
    to college he gave up on owning a restaurant and got a job as an accountant. now he is happy and is going for his masters. my mom is 46 years old and works in IT. she started her career working for IBM and then she moved onto Seko after 5 years and worked at seko for about 13 years before they let her go in 2016
    and in 2017 in june she got a job working for yusen logistics and has been really enjoying it she is now in charge of people that did the job she had at seko which was my moms favorite color
    is pink and when she was younger she played soccer but stopped before high school. also she started working when she was 13 and that's when she met my dad because they worked in the same restaurant.My dog mili is a chocolate lab mix she is 10 years old and loves to play outside in the yard. when we first got Mili i was in kindergarten and my sister was in second grade and my mom told me that we were
    going to get something when we picked up my sister and i thought we were going to get toys but then we went to the shelter and got Mili. she was so tiny and shy she wouldn't want to leave from under a chair
    that was in the room and she was so cute now she roams the backyard by herself and goes by my grandparents house when we're at school. I am the youngest in my family i have a older sister she is 17 and goes to HEHS she was born on february 27 2001, and her favorite color is blue and she plays soccer like me. she enjoys hanging out with her boyfriend and his family also she
    sometimes forgets about me when she with him so i get ignored when i need something or need to go somewhere. this last summer we went to california and she really wants to go to hawaii but i don't want to
    go there. another thing about my sister is she did dance when she was little and gymnastics but she didn't do it for long also she is allergic to peanuts and has asthma so she has been to the ER numerous
    amounts of times because she couldn't breath.</p>
